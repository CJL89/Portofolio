This project is an online portfolio developed during the Front-End Nanodegree.



ARCADE GAME

HOW DO I START THE GAME?
In order to play the Arcade Game you can click on the link of the main page (index.html) or directly click on arcade.html. This will automatically start the game.

WHAT’S THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME?
The main objective of the game is to make it safely to the water without getting trampled by those crazy bugs that are in a rush to get to the other side. BE CAREFUL, they won’t yield (if you live in NYC you’ll have a similar experience).

HOW TO PLAY?
Use the arrows on the keyboard to move the player around the board.

WHAT IF I GET TRAMPLED BY A CRAZY BUG?
Unfortunately insurance is not available in this game so you won’t be able to sue that pesky bug. However, we’ll revive you and you can try again (at least you do not have a broken leg ;))

WHY DO I NEED TO REACH THE WATER?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO RUIN THE GAME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS! SHUT UP AND GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, SORRY! SHUT UP AND PLAY!
